# OctoPrint-FilamentDryer

## Description

Most 3d printing filaments will absorb water from the surrounding area, by heating the filament for a prolonged period, most (or all) of that water can be removed.

This plugin uses your 3d printer's heated bed and/or chamber to heat the build volume for as long as needed.

**Note:** Your 3d printer *must* have a heated bed or chamber and *should* have a full enclosure.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
